Projects to help me learn - unlikely part of my Portfolio

Project - Ignite Your Body (Wellness Website)

Okay, I've started off with a simple website to 'get my hands dirty' with HTML and CSS

Just trying to get a bit of a grasp on HTML and CSS before I start complicating matters further by introducing JS.

Plenty of things I know I can do better already but, in summary, these are the things I've dabbled in with this website...

Navigation with fancy line animation above the hovered menu item
Layering in Intro image using 3 layers
Use of Font Awesome icons - have played with ages ago but needed the refresher
Use of 3 columns - although I think I'll be using the Grid CSS property more going forward
Use of smooth scrolling with CSS only for link To Top

Points of Note...

This site is not responsive - pretty disastrous when trying with different screen sizes.
I did use rem most of the time but I don't have any media queries etc. yet (still a lot to learn)
